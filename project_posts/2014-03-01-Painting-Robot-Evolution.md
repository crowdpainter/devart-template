Though we are still finalizing the artificial intelligence and human interface of our painting robot, the mechanical platform on which it will paint has just been completed.  The simplest way to describe it is as an XY Table that can hold a paint brush, dip it in various paint wells, apply strokes, and clean the brush.  Not much different from a CNC Machine except that where a CNC changes tools, this machine changes paints.

The current robot is the fourth painting machine created by Pindar Van Arman.  The following images show the progression of them from the first 30"x30" table made about 8 years ago, to the most recent machine that is still in final testing.
