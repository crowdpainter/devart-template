Crowd Painter is about a lot of things but admittedly does not work without Crowd Participation.  As such we brainstormed on ways to both encourage participation and reward it.  With only a couple of days left in the proposal, the idea came to us.

Anyone who participates gets a print of the art as well as chance at the original.  Each kiosk will have a printer as well as a touchscreen for painting.  Once a particpant has contributed at least one stroke, they will be able to print out the current state of the painting.  Each print will be timestamped and numbered in series.  If you are connected remotely or on a wireless device you can download a digital copy.

Furthermore, anyone who contributes can submit their email to be put into a lottery for the signed original painting.  The winner will be contacted and the original painting will be mailed to them as soon as the exhibition is over.

This is a way to both encourage participation and share the art with anyone who decides to join in. Afterall they are the artists.
