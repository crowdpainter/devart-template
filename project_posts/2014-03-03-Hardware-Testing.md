With the new robot and robotic heads ready for testing, the first painting done was of one of the artists newborn children.  Though it did not implement all of the algorithms available to Crowd Painter, it covered a test of mechanics, the controller, basic AI, as well as its internet interface.

The first strokes tested were from the internet interface.  These initial human guided stokes dipped the brush in paint and painted a contour of the face.

After one of the artists began the painting, the AI took over and began adding cross hatched strokes.

The final painting which took approximately 24 hours to complete was a combination of the artists brush strokes as enterred through a web interface and the robots built in AI.  A timelapse of the painting being painted can be seen below.
