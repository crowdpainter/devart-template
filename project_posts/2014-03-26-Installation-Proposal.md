3. Wireless connection

Each touchscreen kiosk would have a custom Android application that would display a painting interface as well as a printer. User could use the kiosks to take control of the painting robot.  Multiple users would be able to participate at once. At any time, a users would be able to request a printout of the current state of the canvas and the printer would produce it.

The television would show a live feed of the robot and the current painting. In real time, it would show the robot reacting to the participants instructions.   When there are no gallery participants, the robot AI will take over and paint.  The robot will always be moving.

The wireless connection is for participants with their own wireless devices. Anyone with a touchscreen will be able to connect and participate in real time.  Also any of these particpants can request a digital print of the canvas at any time by providing their email.

We would provide a new painting each day for the duration of the exhibit. We also offer several additional options:

1. This is a truly distributed application, we could do installations at other locations at the same time. For instance, if the Barbican had sister galleries in Tokyo and Washington DC, we could do installations there as well and they would all be able to participate.
2. We can allow internet participants or limit it to only allow gallery participants.
3. We can provide the Barbican with it's own robot setup (robot, server, cameras, etc.). We would hire a local artist (or train a Barbican employee) to set up the paintings on a daily basis for the duration of the exhibit.
4. Depending on the location of the installation in the gallery we could provide a second rear facing flat screen television. 
5. We could set up a mesh to hang completed work during the exhibition. Depending on the robot location, we would overnight the paintings on a daily basis.
