# Proposal

In the gallery space provided, we propose to install 

1: Large Monitor with Live Feed of a Painting Robot
2: 3 Touchscreen Kiosks for Visitors to Take Control of the Painting Robot
3: Printers for Visitors to Make Prints of the Work in Progress 
4: Open Wireless Connection for Visitors to Control Robot from their own Touchscreen Devices

Each touchscreen kiosk would have a custom Android application and a printer. User could use the touchscreen to take control of a painting robot and paint.  Multiple users would be able to participate at once. At any time, a users would be able to request a printout of the current state of the canvas and the printer would produce it for them to take home.

The television would show a live feed of the painting robot and the current painting. It would show the robot reacting to the participants instructions.   When there are no gallery participants, the robot AI will take over and paint.  The robot will usually be moving on the screen. Depending on exhibition space, the actual robot could be installed instead of the screen.

The wireless connection is for participants with their own wireless devices. Anyone with a touchscreen will be able to connect to the robot and participate in the painting in real time.  Also any of these wireless particpants can request a digital print of the canvas at any time.

We would provide a new painting each day for the duration of the exhibit. We also offer several additional options:

1. This is a truly distributed application, we could do installations at other locations at the same time. For instance, if the Barbican had sister galleries in Tokyo and Washington DC, we could do installations there as well and they would all be able to participate.
2. We can allow internet participants or limit it to only allow gallery participants.
3. We can provide the Barbican with it's own robot setup (robot, server, cameras, etc.). We would hire a local artist (or train a Barbican employee) to set up the paintings on a daily basis for the duration of the exhibit.
4. Depending on the location of the installation in the gallery we could provide a second rear facing flat screen television. 
5. We could set up a mesh to hang completed work during the exhibition. Depending on the robot location, we would overnight the paintings on a daily basis.
