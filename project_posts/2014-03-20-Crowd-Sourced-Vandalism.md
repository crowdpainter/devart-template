One of the unexpected things to emerge in testing was vandalism.  In testing, we have openned up the painting robot to anyone who wants to particpate with no login required.  And similar to how many other crowd-sourced projects get vandalized, a couple of our paintings have already been targeted.  Examples can be seen below.  In one case the vandalism is an interesting part of the piece and in the other, the malignant brush strokes were repaired by other participants.

In the above painting someone painted a yellow Sponge Bob Square Pants in the sky.  We think it adds to the piece.

![Vandalism 2](project_images/georgevandalism.jpg?raw=true "Vandalism 2")

In the above painting, the image was vandalized multiple times.  Each time though, other contributors repaired the damage.

It is our view that vandalism is just a part of the finished piece.  

The only exception to this would be if someone painted something hateful like a swastika.  We have mechanisms in place to remove strokes and would remove hateful images from the queue as needed.  On the other hand, if someone were to paint something like a large phallus on the canvas, we would accept that as an artistic contribution and let it be painted.  Our editting policy would be to prevent hate.

We have considered idea of letting all strokes from the kiosk at installation go through in real time, while moderating the strokes from wieless and internet contributors.  It is believed that at the installation you are not anonymous, so you can be trusted,  Ideas about how we edit, and if we even do edit are still be considered.
