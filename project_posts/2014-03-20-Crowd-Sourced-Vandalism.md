One of the unexpected things to emerge in testing was vandalism.  In testing, we have openned up the painting robot to anyone who wants to particpate with no login required.  And similar to how many other crowd-sourced projects such as wikipedia get vandalized, a couple of our paintings have already been targeted.  Examples can be seen below.  In one case the vandalism is an interesting part of the piece and in the other, the malignant brush strokes were repaired by other participants.

In the above painting someone painted a yellow Sponge Bob Square Pants in the sky.  We think it adds to the piece.

In the above painting, the image was vandalized multiple times.  Each time though, other contributors repaired the damage.

It is our view that vandalism is just a part of the finished piece.  

The only exception to this would be if someone painted something hateful like a swastika.  We have mechanisms in place to remove strokes and would remove hateful images from the queue as needed.  On the other hand, if someone were to paint something like a large phallus on the canvas, we would accept that as an artistic contribution and let it be painted.  While this issue is still being decided upon, our current thinking is that we would try prevent hate, but wouldn't do anyhting to prevent obscene contributions. 

Since we would prefer to avoid censorship, one idea we are strongly considering is letting all strokes from the kiosk at installation go through uncensored. Strokes from wireless and internet contributors, however, might be moderated.  It is believed that at the installation you are not anonymous, and therefor can be trusted to keep your contributions artistic.  Ideas about how we edit, and if we even do edit contributions, are still be considered.  We would prefer not to.
