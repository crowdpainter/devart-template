## Description
Our art is an experimentation in artificial intelligence, artificial creativity, and crowd sourced art.  We are building a painting robot in the Washington D.C. area that takes commands from both AI and internet participants to create acrylic paintings and stretched canvas.  This robot uses an artist brush to paint stroke by stroke.  When operating, anyone with an internet connection would be able to visit our website and apply their own strokes.  When no one is applying strokes, the robots built in AI examines what the last human was painting, and takes over from there.  If another command comes in from the internet, the AI hands control back to the new contributor.  In this manner a crowd sourced painting emerges from the collaboration between us, the internet, and our custom written AI.  At the basest level this asks who and what is an artist, at others it asks, does creativity even exist.
